Welcome

This is my software blog, thanks for visiting! Here you will find a collection
of my ramblings on software. Posts are made as a means of helping me think,
reflect, and learn; they are not intended to be authoritative and I claim no
particular expertise on any of the topics discussed here. Any discussion and
feedback is greatly encouraged and warmly received!
