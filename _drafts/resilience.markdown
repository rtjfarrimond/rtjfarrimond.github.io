I'm currently reading Seneca's ['De Consolatione ad Helviam
Matrem'][consolation], in which he writes to his mother 'Helvia' to console her
following his recent exile (for those interested the particular version is
within [this edition][bookLink] of '_On the Shortness of Life_'). The following
paragraph caught my attention; in it he describes how the _'wise men'_ to whom
he has _'surrendered [himself]'_ have instructed him to approach this
adversity:

_"They have ordered me to take a firm stand, like a sentry on guard, and to
foresee all the attacks and the onslaughts of Fortune long before they hit me.
She falls heavily on those to whom she is unexpected; the man who is always
expecting her easily withstands her. For an enemy's arrival too scatters those
to whom it catches off guard; but those who have prepared in advance for the
coming conflict, being properly drawn up and equipped, easily withstand the
first onslaught, which is the most violent."_

We can apply this same manner of thought to how we managing systems in
production.
