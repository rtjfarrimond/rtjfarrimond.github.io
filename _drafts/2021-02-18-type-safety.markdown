In this blog post I hope to present a pattern for integration testing with
Apache Kafka that can be applied to testing both producers and consumers,
though I will go into more detail on the consumer side since this was the scope
of the underlying peice of work that led me to write this post.

## Components

### Kafka

### Zookeeper

### Burrow

- High level overview of Burrow including a link to the project github.
- Breifly touch on how Burrow will be used in this example.

### Primer

### Docker Compose File

- Present an example compose file
- Discuss `wait-for-it` and coordinating container start up dependencies


## Consumer Testing

### Generating Data
